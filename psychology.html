    <p class="small">No single motive fully explains every aspect of criminal behavior, but a combination of psychological traits and situational factors provides insight into Shipman’s conduct.

Power and Control — Shipman targeted primarily elderly patients who depended on him. The dynamics of a physician–patient relationship offered both opportunity and a means to exert decisive control over vulnerable individuals.

Comfort with deception — Publicly he maintained the image of a competent, caring doctor while privately falsifying records and concealing actions. This capacity to deceive was central to how he sustained his behaviour over many years.

Routine and method — His actions displayed systematic features: selection of victims, choice of drug, and record manipulation. This routine character points to deliberate, methodical conduct rather than purely impulsive acts.

Narcissistic tendencies — Accounts of Shipman describe a trait profile consistent with narcissism: an elevated view of his own judgment and a disregard for professional and legal constraints.

Personal influence — Witnessing his mother’s dying process and the administration of morphine has been cited as a formative event; clinicians have considered that this experience may have informed his methods and attitudes toward end-of-life drug use.</p>
    <blockquote>Patterned offending with professional privilege — investigators cite control, deception and routine as central themes.</blockquote>
