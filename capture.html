    <p class="small" style="margin-top:12px">Concerns escalated after the death of Kathleen Grundy in 1998, when family members questioned the circumstances and discovered a will that appeared to have been forged in Shipman’s favour. Subsequent police inquiries exposed a pattern of suspicious deaths linked to his patients, altered medical records, and evidence of inappropriate drug administration.

Shipman was arrested on 7 September 1998. Following trial in 2000, he was convicted of fifteen murders and one count of forgery and was sentenced to life imprisonment with a recommendation that he never be released. The public inquiry that followed — the Shipman Inquiry — produced broad recommendations affecting controlled-substance monitoring, death-certificate verification, GP accountability and coronial practice. Shipman died in prison in 2004; his death was ruled a suicide.

Post-case reforms — Strengthened controlled-substance prescribing and monitoring; enhanced verification and auditing of death certificates; greater oversight and accountability mechanisms for general practitioners; improvements in coronial and post-mortem procedures.</p>
