    <p class="small">Investigations into Shipman’s practice revealed an extraordinary and tragic scale of deaths connected to his care. Estimates place the number of victims between roughly 215 and 250, based on statistical analysis, toxicology, chart audits, and exhumation results.

Method — Where forensic evidence is available, the cause implicated is typically a fatal administration of diamorphine — medical heroin. Diamorphine is a powerful opioid; in excessive doses it causes respiratory failure and death. Shipman’s clinical knowledge allowed him to obtain, manage, and administer controlled substances.

Victim profile — Most victims were elderly patients, often women over the age of sixty, under his long-term care. Many deaths were initially certified by Shipman himself as natural, which delayed scrutiny.

Record manipulation & early misconduct — Investigators found altered medical charts and cases where death certification and drug administration did not align with expected clinical practice. An early sign of misconduct occurred in 1976 when forged prescriptions for pain medication were detected and Shipman received a fine and went through rehabilitation, but he continued to practice thereafter.</p>
